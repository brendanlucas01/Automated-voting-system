# Automated-voting-system

The system is a closed circuit to avoid interference from external entities.

The system is composed of multiple voting units communicating with the Central Governing Unit. While communication, the integrity of data and speed of transmission are preserved.

The functionalities of each unit are mutually exclusive and for intents and purposes a true black box to all external entities.

The vote submitted is anonymous to protect the identity of the voter.
